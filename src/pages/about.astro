          I'm a Software Engineer with a deep passion for robotics and the intricate dance 
          between hardware and software. My journey into robotics began with a fascination 
          for how code can manifest as physical motion, how algorithms can perceive and 
          navigate the world, and how systems can learn and adapt in real-time.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Specializing in robotics has meant becoming fluent in both domains—understanding 
          the constraints of physical systems while leveraging the power of modern software 
          engineering. I work on autonomous navigation systems, sensor fusion algorithms, 
          and real-time control architectures that require precise coordination between 
          perception, planning, and actuation.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The hardware/software integration challenge is what drives me. It's not just about 
          writing efficient code—it's about understanding sensor characteristics, actuator 
          dynamics, computational constraints, and the physics of the environment. Every 
          system is a unique puzzle where software decisions have tangible consequences in 
          the physical world.

          This digital garden serves as a space to document my explorations, experiments, 
          and reflections on building intelligent robotic systems. Here you'll find writings 
          on technical deep-dives, project showcases, and thoughts on the evolving landscape 
          of robotics engineering.
